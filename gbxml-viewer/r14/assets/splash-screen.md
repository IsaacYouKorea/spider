### 2018-10-30: Many things happening

Spider gbXML Viewer is embedded in latest release of [OpenStudio]( https://www.openstudio.net/). See the [Ladybug Tools forum]( https://discourse.ladybug.tools/t/spider-gbxml-viewer-embedded-in-openstudio/4129 ) for details.

The code for the OpenStudio edition is maintained in a new repository: [Spider gbXML Tools]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-gbxml-tools/ ). This code is simpler, faster and better than the current releases.

So have a look at [Spider gbXML Viewer Basic]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-gbxml-tools/gbxml-viewer-basic ) and all the modules in the [Cookbook]( https://www.ladybug.tools/spider-gbxml-tools/#./cookbook/README.md ). These scripts will be the basis for future release of the Viewer.

<summary class="text-primary" >Welcome 2018-06-21 ~ R14.6 ~ Concept for this release</summary>

* Try and get all modules fitting into some kind of cohent whole
	* See if we can get this to be a big release that lasts several months
* Variable and functions clear, consistent, understandable names throughout
* Pass W3C and JSHint validation throughout
* Two window solution instead of three
* gbXML file load-time errors and useful stats reporting easily accessible and visible
* Issues Panel: big cleanup / add find faulty surface inclusions
* Heads-up display: Now named 'CTX Context menu' / Add vertex editing capabilities
* Doors and windows clickable

All of the above should be dealt with before we have after a release candidate. After we have a release candidate then we can start adding new features. These include

* Editable vertices
* Fixes for every issue found
* Ways of automating the update notices process - to let you know what's new every day
